375SWAPTeam2
============

## Rules

###A

On every coding change or comment you make, precede that line or area of code with a comment line which says:

>// SWAP 1, TEAM 2


Mark good OO quality additions as:

>//QUALITY CHANGES


### B

CalendarGUI.java + Config.java  = two changes in each


Schedule.calculateNextMonth:

>Convert this method into smaller methods, each of which have a single purpose and greater cohesion.  Explain how you did this. 

On each of these, comment what additional features could be enabled by the refactoring.

### C

Find 10 different smells. Put a comment above each:

> SMELL: <name of smell> - <explanation>

On each SMELL you identify, also describe the kind of enhancement that the change would enable.  Don’t do those changes, but do comment them in enough detail that someone else could do so.

### D

1. First making the existing code ready for the change.  Describe: 
    1. What "smell" you overcame, and 
    2. How you refactored the code to overcome that.   Then,
2. Make the enhancement without more changes the existing code ("any" is best, "not much" is pretty good)
    1. In each of the features, below, outline, in the tagged comments that go with them, how you used this required methodology!


Add one additional "bonus feature" from the list at the bottom of the 221 assignment. (I believe the program does not do any of these, at present.)  Label all the areas where you make related changes to enable this, with the tag BONUS FEATURE.  At the main place where you added the enabling code, describe the feature.

Note:  I believe that  the last one is tricky:  "Accept personal calendars and not schedule individuals when they are not available."  As an example of the format you would see, I included my own upcoming calendar in the file, "Chenoweth Stephen V Calendar.ics", which is output from MS-Outlook.  It’s tricky!

Make the program do an additional feature of your own invention, something which is difficult to add with one of the bad smells you already identified above, but easy if you fix that smell!  Label this one as ADDITIONAL FEATURE, and make your comments that go with it clear, so that the team receiving your code in the next Swap can check it out.


## Turnin:

1. This will be "due" at the start of class, Monday, Mar 24.  That’s a hard deadline, because if you miss it, you leave the next team, who will work on your code, with nothing to do!  The turn-in will be a zipped version of the Eclipse program files for the program, like the way you received it, but now ready to pass on to the next team.

2. In class, you will find out the names for the team you will send it to.  You can email the zipped files to them directly, at the start of class.

3. During class, you also need to turn in the zipped files to me, in a drop box on Moodle!  One copy per team.
